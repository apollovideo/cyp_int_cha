Find all the basketball scores from last night on https://www.basketball-reference.com/

If any team won by more than 5, fail the test.  

For every game up to and including the game that failed the test, print the scores.  

Feel free to print the team names for extra applause, but not important.

To start you will need to install cypress
npm install cypress --save-dev
